    <h3>About Leica 0-Series Photography Studios</h3>
    
    <p>
        Leica 0-Series Photography Studios is a local studio named after <strong>Leica O-Series</strong> camera brand produced in <em>1923</em> that broke records to become the most <em>expensive</em> camera ever sold. <img src="images/Leica O-series camera.jpg"> The model is one of only 25 ever produced, which were created as test devices two years before the launch of the first official Leica release.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the Leica 0-series Photography Studios is named in honour and remembrance of its founder <strong>Ernst Leitz.</strong></p>
